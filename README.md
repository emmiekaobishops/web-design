# web-design

Some notes:
1. This is a website for an organization that does not exist yet (but hopefully will soon!). As such, I currently don't have any photos from activities or meetings run together, which is why a lot of the photos are examples or logos.
2. The carousels, for instance, all only have the larger text logo with a Call to Action button. I am hoping that as we progress, I will be able to add photos that are more relevant to each individual page.
3. Some of the carousel buttons don't work perfectly the first time around but are fine after a few tries... I could not figure out why that happened.
4. The bios and cards from who_are_we.html are also not finalized, but I could easily enter a passage or a photo once I have them.
5. The Call to Action is the "Learn More" button on the carousel, which appears in most of the pages. If it does not appear on a page, then I have most likely decided that it is unnecessary with the context of the page.
6. The color scheme is navy, and all excess CSS styling is in style.css.
7. I had to change the navbar setup because it would originally not work on a compressed screen size. So, instead of dropbtn items, the dropdown buttons are now dropdown-menu items.
8. I could not figure out how to make the navbar "active" without adding a lot of excess JavaScript... Simply adding an "active" class did not work.
9. A lot of the passages I added would most likely be revised before actually publishing the website.

Thank you!
