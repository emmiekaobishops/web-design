Have you ever wondered how you can use those mad math and programming skills to solve real-world problems? If so, join Data Science for Change! Data science is the use of math and computer science to guide effective policymaking. At Data Science for Change, club members will learn about the different aspects of data science, including data collection, cleaning, and analysis. Using real-world examples, we will discuss “good” and “bad” uses of data science. Finally, we will delve deeper into the field of data science by running our own project, in which we will use our own data to answer a community-related guiding question voted on by club members.
