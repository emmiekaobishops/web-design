        <p class = "text-white">We will have already established connections to
          larger data science organizations for the final steps of the strategic
           plan as well as easily accessible meeting spaces. One issue that we
           will have to think about more is attendance and how we might advertise
           to the greater San Diego community. This includes both middle and
           high schools with interested students. We can send emails to teachers
           in these schools and use the few already-established connections we
           have in order to promote the nonprofit to these institutions. The
           greatest opportunity for the organization lies in the fact that many
           middle and high schoolers do not know about the intersection of STEM
           and humanities fields, and those who wish to pursue both can do so
           through data science. However, this goes both ways, and many students
           may only wish to pursue STEM or humanities. Because of this, we must
           be careful when marketing so as to appeal to all students with a wide
           variety of interests.</p>
