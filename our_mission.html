          In order to educate students on the different aspects of data science, we will hold workshops regarding the mathematics, computer science, and public policy behind it. We hope to familiarize students with concepts and tools that will help them in the true field of data science, such as software and common programs run by data scientists in the field. In order to do this, students will participate in lessons and activities, meeting peers from across San Diego with a shared passion.

          <br />Throughout the next two years, we hope to run 22-24 monthly workshops on topics such as data collection, data representation and analysis, and policy-making. Classes of 15-20 students will meet for three-hour classes on the weekends, and each class will meet for a year. After the year, interested students will be connected with data science organizations such as the San Diego Data Library, where they will have the opportunity to run their own data science projects in the real world. Additionally, students will be encouraged to start their own Data Science for Change clubs at their schools, which can also help to advertise the nonprofit to different institutions around San Diego.
